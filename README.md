# Zipper
Python script to zip or unzip.

If need processing other format, It would be better using os.system(command) with external compresser.

# Note
  - Input absolute PATH, such as 'C:\Users\user\Documents\GitHub'.
  - Only folders under PATH will be zipped.
  - Only '.zip' files under PATH will be unzipped.
